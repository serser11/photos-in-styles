# photos-in-styles
**Introduction**

A mobile app that enables you to upload your photos and transform them to different styles.
Styles include but are not limited to: mosaic, black and white, abstract coloring, etc.

These style translations are trained by our models using CNN using online data sources.

----

**Small Walk Through**

First view is to log in. Once you have created an account, your informatio will be stored in
our database (will work on security and privacy of course). But basically this means you can
log in again next time using the same account and see photos that you uploaded before in your
storyboard.

Once you have uploaded photos and chosen your style (or choose to keep your photo in orignal state),
you can upload it to your storyboard. You can also choose to share the location of this photo
and so it will appear on the world map.

----

**Main Functionality**

The most fun part of this app is that you can actually see what other people post at these locations,
and what styles they applied to their photos. You can also try their styles and customize your photos 
in your storyboard if you change your mind (we will have a copy of your original photo even when you 
choose styles).

**Further Development**

When our databas grow large, we can also perform data analysis and extend to answering questions like
what styles do people use the most in this region/city/country/postal code district. Or more, like when
people open/use this app most frequently and page view time and activity and stuff.

Also, privacy and security as I mentioned.

Moreover, efficiency and database storage if data becomes large.

**Happy exploring**

This project development is still ongoing and many parts will be frequently updated .
But feel free to connect it to your phone and have fun trying it yourself!
